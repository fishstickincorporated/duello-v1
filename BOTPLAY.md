# Duello bot-play slice — Postgres, sign-in required

This folder is a separate test slice. It does NOT touch the live SQLite
version in `~/workspace/duello-v1/`. It is pushed to GitHub (branch
`duello-botplay`) and deployed to Render at
https://duello-botplay.onrender.com/ since Oct 30, 2026.

## What this slice is

Bot play only. Sign-in is required before entering the app since Nov 2, 2026: with no valid session the client shows the auth screen, and guest creation (POST /api/guest) was removed, and guest sessions from before the gate authenticate nothing anymore (see below):

- Opening the app requires sign-in: with no stored session, or a
  rejected one, the client shows the auth screen (email/password
  sign-in or sign-up) and no tab bar. A valid session token in
  localStorage under `duello_token` goes straight to Home. Signing
  out returns to the auth screen. A rejected session during game
  start also returns to the auth screen.
- In scope: board, premiums, 6-tile racks, chess clocks (including the
  tap-time clock switch), scoring/bonuses, definitions, Competitive Bot
  and Fishstick, bot 5s think and 20s clock step.
- Endpoints: `POST /api/signup`, `POST /api/signin`,
  `POST /api/signout`, `GET /api/me`, `POST /api/me/update`,
  `POST /api/games`, `GET /api/games/:id`,
  `POST /api/games/:id/validate`, `/play`, `/pass`, `/forfeit`,
  `/shuffle`, `GET /api/define`, `GET /api/words`.
- Out of scope, removed in this slice: friends backend and leaderboards,
  `/api/me/password` (password change), and any friends UI backend. A
  friends/global leaderboard tab UI was added Nov 2, 2026 (mock data
  only, no backend). Real accounts landed Nov 2, 2026: email/password
  signup, sign-in, sign-out, `GET /api/me`, `POST /api/me/update`, and
  real profile stats from finished games. Email-verified signup landed
  Nov 2, 2026: `POST /api/auth/request-code` emails a 6-digit code via
  Resend (verified domain duellogame.com, `RESEND_API_KEY` env var),
  `POST /api/auth/verify-code` checks it and returns a verified token,
  and `POST /api/signup` requires that token. Codes are scrypt hashes
  in `verification_codes`, expire after 10 minutes, allow 5 wrong
  guesses, and a new request replaces the old code (60-second cooldown).
  Password reset landed Nov 2, 2026, reusing the same code machinery with
  a separate `password_reset_codes` table: `POST /api/auth/request-reset`,
  `POST /api/auth/verify-reset-code`, and `POST /api/auth/reset-password`.
  Reset responses never reveal whether an address has an account: the
  request endpoint always reports success for a well-formed email, and
  every verify failure uses the same message. A successful reset changes
  the password, spends the code, and deletes every session for that user,
  so all devices sign in again. The sign-in screen has a Forgot password
  link leading a three-step flow (email, code, new password plus
  confirmation).
  Profile editing landed Nov 2, 2026: the gear on the profile tab (a real
  cog icon; the earlier icon read as a sun) opens an edit screen with
  photo upload, name, and username, plus a password change section.
  Photos upload as data URLs through `POST /api/me/update` (image only,
  750KB cap, null clears the photo; the column already existed via an
  idempotent migration). Password change is `POST /api/me/password`
  (signed in, current password plus new password, 8 minimum); it ends
  every other session and keeps the current one.
  Nov 2, 2026 checklist refinements: the password section starts as a
  lone Change password button (grey with a Duello blue border only, no
  solid fill) and the Current/New/Confirm fields appear only after it
  is tapped, matching the prototype; the profile Joined line shows
  month and year only; the 1 month / 1 year / All time chart toggles
  are bold.
  Guests are not an option at
  all: POST /api/guest was removed Nov 2, 2026, and a session issued to
  a guest before that authenticates nothing anymore — loading the app
  with one shows the auth screen, and signing up from there creates a
  brand-new account at 1000, leaving the guest row orphaned and inert.
  The guest upgrade path and the Start fresh button, both added Nov 2,
  2026, were removed the same day when guests were taken out entirely.
  No Google/Apple OAuth yet.

Game logic, validation, scoring, and the bot solver were NOT changed
in behaviour — only the database layer, the auth surface, and the
screens around the game were changed.

## How to run it locally

Prerequisites: Node >= 22, PostgreSQL 16, and the dictionary files in
`data/` (`words.txt`, `definitions.json` — already in this folder).

1. Create a local test database (example names; use your own password):
   ```
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE USER duello_test WITH PASSWORD 'duello_test';"
   sudo -u postgres psql -c "CREATE DATABASE duello_botplay_test OWNER duello_test;"
   ```
2. Install dependencies (only runtime dependency is `pg`):
   ```
   cd ~/workspace/duello-botplay
   npm install --omit=dev
   ```
3. Start the server. `DATABASE_URL` is REQUIRED — the server exits at
   startup with a clear error if it is missing, and there is no SQLite
   fallback in this slice, so a local run actually proves Postgres works:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgres://duello_test:duello_test@localhost:5432/duello_botplay_test" PORT=3460 node server.js
   ```
   On first start the server creates the four tables from
   `db/postgres-schema.sql` (users, sessions, games, elo_history) if
   they do not exist, plus a `photo_data` column on users for later
   slices (not used by bot play).
4. Run the smoke test (in another terminal, with the server running):
   ```
   BASE=http://localhost:3460 npm test
   ```
   That test covers: guest creation (username `guest_*`, Elo 1000),
   a Competitive Bot game (it picks a human-first game, since the
   first-move finder assumes an empty board; bot-first candidates are
   abandoned, not forfeited), a valid first play, forfeit with Elo
   moving (1000 -> 984 on a forfeit loss), a second game with the
   SAME token carrying the same Elo and the old game still loading,
   a pass, definitions for ZA/JA/QI/ZEN/DUELLO, and `/api/me` and
   `/api/friends` returning 404.

## What was verified locally (Oct 30, 2026)

- PostgreSQL 16.15 installed locally via apt and started with
  `pg_ctlcluster 16 main start`.
- `node server.js` with no `DATABASE_URL` exits with:
  `DATABASE_URL is required: ...` (exit code 1).
- Smoke test passed (see `scripts/smoke-test-botplay.js`): guest,
  Competitive game, play AE for +2, forfeit Elo 1000 -> 984, second
  game with the same token showed Elo 984, old game reloaded as
  finished 2-0, pass returned to bot turn, definitions all returned.
- Bot move after a pass: bot played AIN for +4, turn returned to the
  human, bot clock stepped to 280,000 ms (the next 20s mark).
- Shuffle preserved the rack multiset; Fishstick game created with
  botElo 3000.
- Frontend shell: `/` contains home/bot/game/friends screens
  (friends is UI only); `/app.js` calls only `/api/guest`,
  `/api/games`, and `/api/define`.

## Later Render step (NOT done in this task)

Jeff does this himself, later, when bot play is right:

1. In the Render dashboard, create a paid Postgres instance.
2. Deploy this folder as a web service (Docker, see `render.yaml`;
   no persistent disk is needed — data lives in Postgres).
3. Set `DATABASE_URL` in the Render dashboard to that Postgres
   instance. Do NOT put the URL in git or in `render.yaml`.
4. Redeploy, create a test guest, play a game, redeploy again, and
   confirm the same guest token still loads the same Elo/games.
   Steps 1–3 were done Oct 30, 2026. The redeploy-survival check
   PASSED Nov 2, 2026: a test guest forfeited from Elo 1000 to 984,
   Render redeployed (words-list ETag changed), and the same guest
   token reloaded Elo 984 with its finished game intact.

## Later slices (NOT in this task)

Friends backend, password change (reset is built), Google/Apple OAuth, ads, and
payments. (Real accounts and the profile tab landed Nov 2, 2026; the
friends tab UI is mock-only until its backend lands.)
